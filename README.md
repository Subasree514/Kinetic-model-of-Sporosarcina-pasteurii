'Data.mat' file contains the concentration data of biomass (gDW/l), glucose (g/l), extracellular urea concentration (mmol/l), intracellular urea concentration (mmol/l) cell, intracellular ammonium concentration (mmol/l) cell and extracellular ammonium concentration (mmol/l)

'sddata.mat' contains the respective experimental standard deviation data

'ODEfile' contains the function of the rate equations of the system and 'lsqfun' contains the function for calculation of errors 

'lsqRUNfile' must be executed for fitting the experimental vs. simulated values using nonlinear data-fitting
