### Experimental data of biomass and metabolites measured
'Data.mat' file contains the concentration data of biomass (gDW/l), glucose (g/l), extracellular urea concentration (mmol/l), intracellular urea concentration (mmol/l) cell, intracellular ammonium concentration (mmol/l) cell and extracellular ammonium concentration (mmol/l)

'sddata.mat' contains the respective experimental standard deviation data

### Function files of the ODE-based kinetic model of growth and ureolysis in Sporosarcina pasteurii and non-linear least squares
'ODEfile' contains the function of the rate equations of the system, and 'lsqfun' contains the function for the calculation of errors 

### File to execute data-fitting and plotting
'lsqRUNfile' must be executed for fitting the experimental vs. simulated values using nonlinear data-fitting
